# Neural Networks Guided Interaction Detection in Multiple Data Views

Welcome to the official implementation of our paper, "Neural Networks Guided Interaction Detection in Multiple Data Views." This repository contains a PyTorch-based framework for detecting and analyzing feature interactions between two data views.

### Components

#### Neural Network Models:
- **TwinterNet.py**: Implementation of the TwinterNet architecture designed for detecting complex feature interactions between two data views.
- **BetweenView_Interaction_detection.py**: Handles interaction detection specifically between different views, integral to the TwinterNet model.

#### Supporting Methods:
- **Other Methods**: A collection of other methods provided in the "other methods" folder, offering comparisons for interaction detection.

#### Simulations and Utilities:
- **Simulations**: Contains scripts to run various simulations for evaluating the performance of the TwinterNet model and other methods.
- **utils.py**: A set of utility functions that streamline data preprocessing, interaction detection, and evaluation tasks.

### Demo:
A user-friendly PyTorch demo is included, which provides a step-by-step guide to applying the TwinterNet model to your own interaction detection tasks.

### Getting Started:
1. **Clone the Repository**: Start by cloning the repository to your local machine.
2. **Run the Demo**: Follow the instructions in the demo to see how the TwinterNet model can be used for interaction detection in a two-view dataset.
3. **Explore the Code**: Dive into the `TwinterNet.py` and `BetweenView_Interaction_detection.py` files to understand the architecture and methodology.
4. **Run Simulations**: Use the scripts in the `simulations` folder to test the model under various conditions.
